# BlogRenderingJS

Using the  features of Asynchronous JavaScript we are creating  a blog page. The blog page fetches data from a remote repository or data source through asynchronous JavaScript fetching mechanisms. The rendered blog page should contain a list of related links that contain the title of other blogs. Upon clicking the related link, details of this new blog will be displayed.
